# cosmic-applet-google

A pair of COSMIC desktop panel applets that surface bits of your Google
account in the panel:

| Applet | Binary | What it shows | Icon |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Gmail Unread](#gmail-applet) | `cosmic-applet-gmail` | Number of unread Gmail messages, refreshed periodically. |![gmail-preview.png](cosmic-applet-gmail/gmail-preview.png)|
| [Next meeting](#google-agenda-applet) | `cosmic-applet-google-agenda` | Next Google Calendar event with a live countdown, plus a desktop notification a few minutes before it starts. |![calendar-preview.png](cosmic-applet-google-agenda/calendar-preview.png)|

Both applets follow the same model:

- **Left-click** the panel item → opens a useful URL (Gmail inbox / next
  event's Meet link, falling back to <https://calendar.google.com>).
- **Right-click** → menu with **Credentials**. Selecting it spawns the same
  binary with `--show-settings`, which runs as a regular Wayland toplevel
  window (not a panel popup) so it survives focus changes — including
  switching to a password manager to paste the secret.
- Settings (email, OAuth client ID, intervals, toggles) live in cosmic-config.
- Secrets (OAuth client secret, refresh token, access token) live in the
  freedesktop Secret Service (e.g. gnome-keyring under COSMIC).
- They share an OAuth + keyring helper crate ([`cosmic-google-common`](cosmic-google-common/)),
  so adding more Google-backed applets later only requires implementing the
  applet-specific UI and API call.

## Build & install

Requires Rust 1.85+ (for `edition = "2024"`), `just`, and a working Wayland
session. On Pop!_OS / COSMIC the Secret Service backend is gnome-keyring;
it must be running for either applet to remember credentials.

```sh
just build-release
just install-user        # installs both applets into ~/.local; use `sudo just install` for /usr
```

`just install-user` lays each applet's binary, desktop entry, and icon into:

- `~/.local/bin/cosmic-applet-{gmail,google-agenda}`
- `~/.local/share/applications/com.github.ragusa87.CosmicApplet{Gmail,GoogleAgenda}.desktop`
- `~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/com.github.ragusa87.CosmicApplet{Gmail,GoogleAgenda}.svg`

> ⚠️ `~/.local/bin` must be on your `$PATH` — the panel runs the binary by
> name (`Exec=cosmic-applet-gmail` / `Exec=cosmic-applet-google-agenda`)
> and resolves it via `PATH`. Most distros add it automatically; check with
> `echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n' | grep .local/bin`.

If you only want one of the two:

```sh
cargo build --release -p cosmic-applet-gmail
# or
cargo build --release -p cosmic-applet-google-agenda
```

### Add an applet to the panel

A COSMIC panel applet is **not** a standalone program — `just run-gmail`
(or running either binary directly) will not produce a panel icon, because
applets are spawned by the COSMIC panel as Wayland sub-surfaces. Once
installed:

1. **Settings → Desktop → Panel** (or right-click the panel → *Configure*).
2. Scroll to **Applets** → **Add Applet**.
3. Pick **Gmail Unread** and/or **Next meeting** from the list and drag it
   into Left, Center, or Right.

If the entry does not appear in the Add-Applet list, the panel has cached
its applet index. Force a re-scan with one of:

```sh
pkill cosmic-panel        # the session manager respawns it within ~1s
# or: log out and back in
```

Then proceed to the [one-time Google Cloud setup](#one-time-google-cloud-setup)
below, and right-click the new panel icon → **Credentials** to authorize.

### Uninstall

```sh
just uninstall-user       # or `sudo just uninstall` for /usr
```

Removes the binary, desktop entry, and icon for **both** applets.

## One-time Google Cloud setup

Each applet uses a **bring-your-own-credentials** model: instead of shipping
a shared OAuth client (which would be capped at 100 unverified users), each
user creates their own Google Cloud OAuth client. Roughly 5 minutes once
per applet (the two applets can share a Google Cloud project but each needs
its own scope and client ID).

1. Open <https://console.cloud.google.com/> and create a new project (any
   name) — or reuse an existing one.
2. **APIs & Services → Library** → enable the API you need:
   - For Gmail Unread: **Gmail API**.
   - For Next meeting: **Google Calendar API**.
3. **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**:
   - User type: **External**.
   - App name: anything (e.g. "My COSMIC Google Bundle"), support email: your own.
   - **Scopes** → add the scope your applet needs:
     - Gmail Unread: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.metadata`
     - Next meeting: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.readonly`
   - **Test users** → add your own Google account.
   - Leave the app in **Testing** mode (don't submit for verification —
     you're the only user).
4. **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → OAuth client ID**:
   - Application type: **Desktop app**.
   - Name: anything.
   - Click **Create**. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret**.
5. Right-click the applet in the panel → **Credentials**. The applet
   spawns itself with `--show-settings`, which opens a standalone window
   with the form. It's a real toplevel window so clicking other apps (e.g.
   a password manager) won't dismiss it. Close it with one of:
   - **Authorize with Google** — runs the OAuth flow (opens a browser tab
     to Google's consent screen; granting access redirects to a "you can
     close this tab" page) and exits the settings window once the refresh
     token is stored.
   - **Cancel** — exits without saving.
   - The window manager's ✕ button — same as Cancel.

   The panel applet picks up the new credentials automatically: when
   settings writes to cosmic-config, the applet's config watcher fires and
   triggers a reload of the tokens from Secret Service.

You can also launch the settings window directly without going through the
panel:

```sh
cosmic-applet-gmail --show-settings
cosmic-applet-google-agenda --show-settings
```

## Forcing a refresh

Each applet polls on its own cadence. To trigger an immediate refresh:

```sh
pkill -USR2 -f cosmic-applet-gmail            # poll Gmail right now
pkill -USR2 -f cosmic-applet-google-agenda    # refetch calendar right now
```

Or, to signal both at once:

```sh
just refresh
```

On receiving SIGUSR2, the applet reloads the OAuth tokens from Secret
Service and fetches right away. The settings windows (running under the
same binary names) ignore SIGUSR2, so sending the signal to all processes
with that name is safe — only the panel applet acts on it.

### Pre-filling credentials from the environment

For local development, the client ID and secret are read from environment
variables when the form field is empty:

```sh
# Gmail applet
export GMAIL_APPLET_CLIENT_ID=...apps.googleusercontent.com
export GMAIL_APPLET_CLIENT_SECRET=GOCSPX-...

# Agenda applet
export AGENDA_PANEL_CLIENT_ID=...apps.googleusercontent.com
export AGENDA_PANEL_CLIENT_SECRET=GOCSPX-...
```

A persisted value (from a previous **Authorize** click) always wins over
the environment.

## Gmail applet

Reads the unread count via the Gmail API's
[`users.labels.get`](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.labels/get)
endpoint on `INBOX` (the `messagesUnread` field) once per poll interval.

**Configuration** — non-secret settings live in
`~/.config/com.github.ragusa87.CosmicAppletGmail/v1/`:

| Key                  | Default | Notes                                |
|----------------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| `email`              | `""`    | Filled when you click **Authorize**. |
| `client_id`          | `""`    | Same — written from the settings form. |
| `poll_interval_secs` | `60`    | Clamped to a minimum of 15s.         |

You can edit `poll_interval_secs` by hand; the applet picks up changes live.

Secrets are stored under Secret Service entry
`com.github.ragusa87.CosmicAppletGmail:tokens / {email}` as a JSON blob
containing `client_secret`, `refresh_token`, `access_token`, and
`expires_at_unix`.

**Scope rationale** — `gmail.metadata` is the minimum scope that exposes
label counts. The applet calls `users/me/labels/INBOX` once per poll and
reads the `messagesUnread` field — it never reads message bodies, subjects,
or sender addresses.

## Google Agenda applet

Shows the next event on your primary Google Calendar with a live countdown,
and fires a desktop notification a few minutes before it starts. The
countdown (`12m`, `1h`, `now`) updates **every 30s locally** from a cached
event list — the Calendar API is only hit every 5 minutes.

**What gets filtered out** — the applet ignores:

- **Cancelled** events.
- **All-day** events (no precise start time).
- Events you marked as **Free** (Calendar's `transparency=transparent`).
- Events where **you** declined the invite.

**Debugging what the panel sees** — if the panel isn't showing the event
you expect (or *is* showing one you don't), run with `--debug`. It uses
the stored credentials, hits the Calendar API once, and prints every
fetched event to stdout together with the verdict (`KEEP` or
`SKIP — <reason>`):

```sh
cosmic-applet-google-agenda --debug
```

The bottom of the report shows the configured intervals, which event would
be displayed next, and when a notification would fire. No GUI, no panel
required.

**Configuration** — non-secret settings live in
`~/.config/com.github.ragusa87.CosmicAppletGoogleAgenda/v1/`:

| Key                       | Default | Notes                                              |
|---------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `email`                   | `""`    | Filled when you click **Authorize**.               |
| `client_id`               | `""`    | Same — written from the settings form.             |
| `fetch_interval_secs`     | `300`   | Calendar API poll cadence. Clamped to min 60s.     |
| `display_tick_secs`       | `30`    | Local countdown refresh. Clamped to min 5s.        |
| `notification_lead_secs`  | `300`   | Notify this many seconds before start. `0` disables. |
| `show_title`              | `true`  | Show event title next to the countdown.            |

You can edit these by hand; the applet picks up changes live.

Secrets are stored under Secret Service entry
`com.github.ragusa87.CosmicAppletGoogleAgenda / {email}` as a JSON blob
containing `client_secret`, `refresh_token`, `access_token`, and
`expires_at_unix`.

**Scope rationale** — `calendar.events.readonly` is the minimum scope that
exposes event titles, times, and conference data. The applet calls
`calendars/primary/events` once per fetch interval — it never modifies
events, never sees attendee details beyond your own RSVP status, and never
touches other calendars.

## Troubleshooting

- **Gmail panel shows `—` forever** → the applet has no credentials;
  right-click → Credentials to authorize.
- **Gmail panel shows `…` forever** / **Agenda countdown never appears with
  credentials configured** → credentials are present but every fetch is
  failing. Run `RUST_LOG=info cosmic-applet-gmail` (or
  `cosmic-applet-google-agenda`) from a terminal and watch the logs.
- **Agenda shows the icon with no countdown** → either no credentials yet
  (right-click → Credentials) or no upcoming event in the next 24h.
- **`Secret Service unavailable`** → no keyring daemon is running.
  Install / start `gnome-keyring-daemon` (it ships with COSMIC by default).
- **Refresh token expired after a week** → on Google's OAuth consent
  screen in "Testing" mode, refresh tokens expire after 7 days. Either
  re-authorize once a week, or move the app to "In production" (still no
  review needed for a single-user desktop client).
- **Re-authorize from scratch / revoke access** → visit
  <https://myaccount.google.com/connections>, pick the app, and remove its
  access. The next **Authorize with Google** click will run the full
  consent flow again.
