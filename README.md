A bundle of COSMIC desktop panel applets:

| Applet | Binary | What it shows | Icon |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Gmail Unread](#gmail-applet) | `cosmic-applet-gmail` | Number of unread Gmail messages, refreshed periodically. Requires a [Google Cloud OAuth client](#one-time-google-cloud-setup) (you create the access token). |![gmail-preview.png](cosmic-applet-gmail/gmail-preview.png)|
| [Next meeting](#google-agenda-applet) | `cosmic-applet-google-agenda` | Next Google Calendar event with a live countdown, plus a desktop notification a few minutes before it starts. Requires a [Google Cloud OAuth client](#one-time-google-cloud-setup) (you create the access token). |![calendar-preview.png](cosmic-applet-google-agenda/calendar-preview.png)|
| [Taxi tracker](#taxi-tracker-applet) | `cosmic-applet-taxi` | Multi-timer time tracking with daily auto-export to [`taxi`](https://github.com/sephii/taxi) (e.g. Liip's Zebra). |![taxi-preview.png](cosmic-applet-taxi/taxi-preview.png)|
| [Slack Unread](#slack-applet) | `cosmic-applet-slack` | Badge mirroring Slack's tray-icon ToolTip — pulled over DBus, no Slack API, no token. |![slack-preview.png](cosmic-applet-slack/slack-preview.png)|

Jump to a per-applet section below for what each one shows, how to
configure it, and the troubleshooting knobs. Contributors / AI agents:
see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the architectural notes (shared
plumbing, two-mode binary layout, per-crate invariants).

## Build & install

Requires Rust 1.85+ (for `edition = "2024"`), `just`, and a working Wayland
session. On Pop!_OS / COSMIC the Secret Service backend is gnome-keyring;
it must be running for either applet to remember credentials.

```sh
just release             # release build + user install into ~/.local for every applet,
                         # then restart cosmic-panel so it picks up the new binaries
                         # (use `sudo just install-system` after this for /usr)
```

`just release` lays each applet's binary, desktop entry, and icon into:

- `~/.local/bin/<crate>`
- `~/.local/share/applications/<AppId>.desktop`
- `~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/<AppId>.svg`

…for every crate listed in [`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml)'s `[workspace]
members` (the AppIds follow the pattern `com.github.ragusa87.CosmicApplet<CamelCaseName>`).

> ⚠️ `~/.local/bin` must be on your `$PATH` — the panel runs the binary by
> name (`Exec=cosmic-applet-gmail` etc.) and resolves it via `PATH`. Most
> distros add it automatically; check with
> `echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n' | grep .local/bin`.

If you only want one applet:

```sh
just release cosmic-applet-gmail         # or any other workspace crate
```

For tight dev-loop iteration on a single applet (same install + panel
restart, but with the `release-fast` profile for quicker compiles):

```sh
just dev cosmic-applet-gmail
```

### Add an applet to the panel

A COSMIC panel applet is **not** a standalone program — `just run cosmic-applet-gmail`
(or running the binary directly) will not produce a panel icon, because
applets are spawned by the COSMIC panel as Wayland sub-surfaces. Once
installed:

1. **Settings → Desktop → Panel** (or right-click the panel → *Configure*).
2. Scroll to **Applets** → **Add Applet**.
3. Pick **Gmail Unread**, **Next meeting**, **Taxi tracker**,
   **Slack Unread**, and/or **AI Quota Bar** from the list and drag it
   into Left, Center, or Right.

If the entry does not appear in the Add-Applet list, the panel has cached
its applet index. Force a re-scan with one of:

```sh
pkill cosmic-panel        # the session manager respawns it within ~1s
# or: log out and back in
```

Then proceed to the [one-time Google Cloud setup](#one-time-google-cloud-setup)
below, and right-click the new panel icon → **Credentials** to authorize.

### Uninstall

```sh
just uninstall-user       # or `sudo just uninstall-system` for /usr
```

Removes the binary, desktop entry, and icon for **every** applet.

## One-time Google Cloud setup

Each applet uses a **bring-your-own-credentials** model: instead of shipping
a shared OAuth client (which would be capped at 100 unverified users), each
user creates their own Google Cloud OAuth client. Roughly 5 minutes once
per applet (the two applets can share a Google Cloud project but each needs
its own scope and client ID).

1. Open <https://console.cloud.google.com/> and create a new project (any
   name) — or reuse an existing one.
2. **APIs & Services → Library** → enable the API you need:
   - For Gmail Unread: **Gmail API**.
   - For Next meeting: **Google Calendar API**.
3. **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**:
   - User type: **External**.
   - App name: anything (e.g. "My COSMIC Google Bundle"), support email: your own.
   - **Scopes** → add the scope your applet needs:
     - Gmail Unread: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.metadata`
     - Next meeting: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.readonly`
   - **Test users** → add your own Google account.
   - Leave the app in **Testing** mode (don't submit for verification —
     you're the only user).
4. **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → OAuth client ID**:
   - Application type: **Desktop app**.
   - Name: anything.
   - Click **Create**. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret**.
5. Right-click the applet in the panel → **Credentials**. The applet
   spawns itself with `--show-settings`, which opens a standalone window
   with the form. It's a real toplevel window so clicking other apps (e.g.
   a password manager) won't dismiss it. Close it with one of:
   - **Authorize with Google** — runs the OAuth flow (opens a browser tab
     to Google's consent screen; granting access redirects to a "you can
     close this tab" page) and exits the settings window once the refresh
     token is stored.
   - **Cancel** — exits without saving.
   - The window manager's ✕ button — same as Cancel.

   The panel applet picks up the new credentials automatically: when
   settings writes to cosmic-config, the applet's config watcher fires and
   triggers a reload of the tokens from Secret Service.

You can also launch the settings window directly without going through the
panel:

```sh
cosmic-applet-gmail --show-settings
cosmic-applet-google-agenda --show-settings
```

## Forcing a refresh

Each applet polls on its own cadence. To trigger an immediate refresh:

```sh
pkill -USR2 -f cosmic-applet-gmail            # poll Gmail right now
pkill -USR2 -f cosmic-applet-google-agenda    # refetch calendar right now
pkill -USR2 -f cosmic-applet-taxi             # reload taxi state right now
pkill -USR2 -f cosmic-applet-slack            # re-read Slack tooltip right now
pkill -USR2 -f cosmic-applet-quotabar         # refetch AI quotas right now
```

Or, to signal every applet at once:

```sh
just refresh
```

## Gmail applet

Reads the unread count via the Gmail API's
[`users.labels.get`](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users.labels/get)
endpoint on `INBOX` (the `messagesUnread` field) once per poll interval.

**Configuration** — non-secret settings live in
`~/.config/com.github.ragusa87.CosmicAppletGmail/v1/`:

| Key                  | Default | Notes                                |
|----------------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| `email`              | `""`    | Filled when you click **Authorize**. |
| `client_id`          | `""`    | Same — written from the settings form. |
| `poll_interval_secs` | `60`    | Clamped to a minimum of 15s.         |
| `notify`             | `true`  | Desktop notification when the unread count rises. Toggle in settings. |
| `paused`             | `false` | Manual pause (toggled from the right-click menu). |
| `auto_pause_weekend` | `false` | Auto-pause on Saturday/Sunday. Toggle in settings. |

You can edit `poll_interval_secs` by hand; the applet picks up changes live.

**New-mail notification** — when `notify` is on, the applet fires a desktop
notification each time the unread count *increases* (e.g. "2 new messages"). It
stays silent on the first poll after startup and never fires when the count
drops (mail read elsewhere). Toggle it under **Notifications** in the settings
window.

**Pause** — right-click → **Pause** (toggles to **Resume**) stops polling
entirely: no count check, no notifications, and the panel icon greys out
(rendered monochrome) with its badge hidden. Enable **Auto-pause on weekend** in
settings to pause automatically on Saturday/Sunday; it resumes on its own come
Monday. Manual pause and weekend auto-pause are independent — the effective
state is "paused if either applies".

Secrets are stored under Secret Service entry
`com.github.ragusa87.CosmicAppletGmail:tokens / {email}` as a JSON blob
containing `client_secret`, `refresh_token`, `access_token`, and
`expires_at_unix`.

**Scope rationale** — `gmail.metadata` is the minimum scope that exposes
label counts. The applet calls `users/me/labels/INBOX` once per poll and
reads the `messagesUnread` field — it never reads message bodies, subjects,
or sender addresses.

## Google Agenda applet

Shows the next event on your primary Google Calendar with a live countdown,
and fires a desktop notification a few minutes before it starts. The
countdown (`12m`, `1h`, `now`) updates **every 30s locally** from a cached
event list — the Calendar API is only hit every 5 minutes.

**Left-click popup** — shows the current/next event in detail (title, time,
location, and an **Open in Google Meet / Open calendar** button), followed by a
compact **Later** list of the next few upcoming meetings.

**What gets filtered out** — the applet ignores:

- **Cancelled** events.
- **All-day** events (no precise start time).
- Events you marked as **Free** (Calendar's `transparency=transparent`).
- Events where **you** declined the invite.

**Debugging what the panel sees** — if the panel isn't showing the event
you expect (or *is* showing one you don't), run with `--debug`. It uses
the stored credentials, hits the Calendar API once, and prints every
fetched event to stdout together with the verdict (`KEEP` or
`SKIP — <reason>`):

```sh
cosmic-applet-google-agenda --debug
```

The bottom of the report shows the configured intervals, which event would
be displayed next, and when a notification would fire. No GUI, no panel
required.

**Configuration** — non-secret settings live in
`~/.config/com.github.ragusa87.CosmicAppletGoogleAgenda/v1/`:

| Key                       | Default | Notes                                              |
|---------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `email`                   | `""`    | Filled when you click **Authorize**.               |
| `client_id`               | `""`    | Same — written from the settings form.             |
| `fetch_interval_secs`     | `300`   | Calendar API poll cadence. Clamped to min 60s.     |
| `display_tick_secs`       | `30`    | Local countdown refresh. Clamped to min 5s.        |
| `notification_lead_secs`  | `300`   | Notify this many seconds before start. `0` disables. Also settable via a preset dropdown (1/5/10/15/30 min) under **Notifications** in settings. |
| `show_title`              | `true`  | Show event title next to the countdown.            |

You can edit these by hand; the applet picks up changes live.

Secrets are stored under Secret Service entry
`com.github.ragusa87.CosmicAppletGoogleAgenda / {email}` as a JSON blob
containing `client_secret`, `refresh_token`, `access_token`, and
`expires_at_unix`.

**Scope rationale** — `calendar.events.readonly` is the minimum scope that
exposes event titles, times, and conference data. The applet calls
`calendars/primary/events` once per fetch interval — it never modifies
events, never sees attendee details beyond your own RSVP status, and never
touches other calendars.

## Taxi tracker applet

A multi-timer time tracker that auto-exports merged + rounded sessions to
your [taxi](https://github.com/sephii/taxi) timesheet. Designed for the
"start a timer, switch tickets, forget to stop it before lunch, panic at
the end of the day" workflow.

**What it does:**

- One panel button. Left-click opens a popup with one row per timer
  (alias + description + live elapsed + ▶/⏸ button).
- Each timer carries an `alias` (taxi-native, autocompleted from your
  `taxirc` + `taxi alias list`) and a per-session description. Editing
  the description on a running session updates the timer's default so
  the next start pre-fills with it.
- **One timer at a time** — clicking ▶ on a paused row pauses whatever
  was running first. No overlapping ranges to clean up.
- While running, the panel button shows
  `[⏱ _hello: TICKET-1 Setup 01:23 · 04:32]`.
- **fixme: Auto-pause on screen lock / suspend** via DBus
  (`org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver`, `org.freedesktop.login1`).
- **Daily auto-export (Untested)** at a configurable cut-over hour (default `04:00`):
  for each closed session whose work-date is in the past, merge gaps
  under 5 min, round each merged span to ≥ 15 min, append the lines to
  `~/zebra/%Y/%m.tks`, and drop them from local state.
- **Manual Export…** dialog for an arbitrary date — preview the merged
  lines, then confirm to append.
- **Auto-derived timer list**: on startup the applet scans the current
  and previous month's `.tks` and seeds a row per distinct alias used,
  pre-filled with the most recent description. Deleting a row
  suppresses that alias from future auto-derivation.

**Requirements:**

The applet *runs* fine without anything but COSMIC + a Wayland session.
**Taxi features** (alias refresh, export, auto-export) need
[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) on `$PATH`. The applet calls taxi as
`uv run --with taxi,taxi-zebra taxi <args>` (configurable). If `uv` is
not installed, taxi features are hidden from the UI and a small
"Install `uv` to enable taxi export" caption shows in the popup; the
timer functionality still works.

Your existing `~/.config/taxi/taxirc` is read directly for the path
template (`[taxi].file`, default `~/zebra/%Y/%m.tks`), date format
(`[taxi].date_format`), and alias sections (`[default_aliases]`,
`[<backend>_aliases]`).

**Configuration** — non-secret settings live in
`~/.config/com.github.ragusa87.CosmicAppletTaxi/v1/`:

| Key                   | Default                                     | Notes                                          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `cutover_hour`        | `4`                                         | Anything before this hour is the previous day. |
| `merge_gap_minutes`   | `5`                                         | Pause/resume gaps under this collapse to one entry. |
| `round_min_minutes`   | `15`                                        | Each merged span rounded up to at least this.  |
| `taxi_command`        | `uv run --with taxi,taxi-zebra taxi`        | Whitespace-split, args appended.               |
| `taxirc_path`         | `""`                                        | Blank → resolve `~/.config/taxi/taxirc`.       |

State (timer list + sessions) lives in
`~/.local/state/cosmic-applet-taxi/state.json`. Aliases cached by
`taxi alias list` live alongside it.

Open the settings or export window directly:

```sh
cosmic-applet-taxi --show-settings
cosmic-applet-taxi --show-export
```

## Slack applet

Mirrors Slack's own tray-icon unread state. **No Slack API, no token, no
OAuth** — Slack already publishes a `StatusNotifierItem` on your session
bus with a tooltip like `"You have 3 notifications"`; the applet reads
that tooltip and renders the badge.

**Discovery** — Slack registers three sibling connections on the bus
(typically `:1.854`, `:1.855`, `:1.856`); only one of them serves
`/StatusNotifierItem`. The applet:

1. Enumerates session-bus names.
2. Filters to connections whose `/proc/<pid>/comm` is `slack`.
3. Among those, picks the one whose `/StatusNotifierItem` exposes a
   readable `ToolTip` property (with a 500 ms timeout per probe so a
   flaky sibling can't stall the panel).
4. Subscribes to that item's `NewToolTip` signal for instant updates
   and watches `NameOwnerChanged` on the bus to detect Slack
   quitting/restarting. A 2 s rescan when Slack is down and a 5 s
   safety re-read while running cover the cases where the signal
   path stays silent.

**Badge states** — the tooltip text is parsed into three possible states:

| Tooltip text                 | Badge                       |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `You have 3 notifications`   | `3`                         |
| `You have unread messages`   | `•` (dot — count unknown)   |
| `No unread messages`         | (hidden)                    |
| Slack not running            | (hidden, applet icon only)  |

Parsing: first `\d+` match in `title + " " + description` wins (if > 0).
Otherwise a case-insensitive substring check: `"no unread"` /
`"no notification"` → no badge; `"unread"` / `"notification"` → dot
indicator; nothing else matches → no badge.

**Interactions:**

- **Left-click** runs `xdg-open slack:` (Slack registers this URL
  scheme handler on install — typically focuses the existing window).
- **Right-click** opens a one-item menu with **Refresh** (same effect
  as `pkill -USR2 -f cosmic-applet-slack`).

**Debugging what the panel sees** — run with `--debug` to print the
full fetch pipeline once and exit:

```sh
cosmic-applet-slack --debug
```

Output walks each Slack-owned bus name, shows whether `/StatusNotifierItem`
is reachable, prints the raw `ToolTip` tuple (`icon_name`, `icon_count`,
`title`, `description`), the step-by-step parse (digit match, then
keyword fallbacks), and which connection would be chosen. Useful when
Slack changes its tooltip wording in an update — you can see the exact
string and adjust the parser.

For continuous live logging, run the panel applet with
`RUST_LOG=cosmic_applet_slack=debug`: every fetch emits a `tracing`
event with the title, description, and parsed `Unread` variant.

**Configuration** — none. The applet hardcodes the `slack` process
name. If you need to support a different process name (Snap, Flatpak,
forks), edit `SLACK_PROCESS` in `cosmic-applet-slack/src/slack.rs`.

**Requirements** — Slack desktop ≥ recent enough to register a tray
icon via `org.kde.StatusNotifierItem` (standard for years). Wayland +
COSMIC panel as usual. Nothing else.

## QuotaBar applet

`cosmic-applet-quotabar` is a Rust / libcosmic port of the Swift
[`mr-chatter`](https://github.com/Jonathanm10/mr-chatter) project
(formerly `QuotaBar`) by Jonathan M. It shows your remaining
**OpenAI** + **Anthropic** API quotas in the COSMIC panel by reading
the local OAuth sessions that the Claude Code and Codex CLIs already
maintain — **no extra credentials, no API keys, no Google Cloud
setup**.

This crate is **MIT-licensed** to match the upstream project; see
[`cosmic-applet-quotabar/LICENSE`](cosmic-applet-quotabar/LICENSE).
The rest of the workspace stays GPL-3.0-or-later.

**What you see** — the panel button shows the worst-used percentage
across both providers (e.g. `8%`). Left-click opens a popup with a
horizontal bar per provider × window (Daily = 5h, Weekly = 7d),
color-graded from green (low) through orange to red (≥ 90%). Right-click
gives a **Refresh** / **Settings…** menu.

**How auth works** — there is no OAuth flow inside the applet:

- **Anthropic** — reads `~/.claude/.credentials.json` (the file
  Claude Code writes after `claude login`), refreshes the token via
  `platform.claude.com/v1/oauth/token` when it's expired, then calls
  `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` to fetch the 5h / 7d
  utilization. Refreshed tokens are written back to the same file
  atomically.
- **OpenAI** — reads `~/.codex/auth.json` (the file the Codex CLI
  writes after `codex login`), refreshes via
  `auth.openai.com/oauth/token` when needed, then calls
  `chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` for the primary / secondary
  rate-limit windows. API-key-only auth modes
  (`OPENAI_API_KEY` in `auth.json`) are intentionally rejected — the
  ChatGPT usage endpoint requires an OAuth session.

If either local credential file is missing the applet keeps working
with the other provider; the missing one shows an inline warning in
the popup.

**Refresh cadence** — every **5 minutes** automatically, plus on
demand via the popup's Refresh button, the right-click menu, or
`pkill -USR2 -f cosmic-applet-quotabar`.

**Threshold alert** — when usage crosses a configurable percentage, the applet
fires a desktop notification (e.g. "Anthropic Weekly usage at 92%") so you don't
have to open the popup to notice. It fires on the **rising edge** — the poll
where a window goes from below the threshold to at/above it (and on the first
poll after startup if a window is already over) — so staying over the line
across many 5-minute polls won't re-nag. It re-arms when usage drops back below
the threshold (e.g. after the window resets).

**Configuration** — the endpoints, OAuth client IDs, and credential file paths
are hardcoded. Right-click → **Settings…** opens a standalone window (spawned via
`--show-settings`) with an "Notify me on quota threshold" toggle and a threshold
dropdown. The two non-secret settings live in
`~/.config/com.github.ragusa87.CosmicAppletQuotaBar/v1/` (also editable by hand;
changes apply live via the config watcher):

| Key                   | Default | Notes                                             |
|-----------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `alert_enabled`       | `true`  | Fire the threshold notification.                  |
| `alert_threshold_pct` | `90`    | Percent (0–100) at or above which the alert fires.|

```sh
cosmic-applet-quotabar --show-settings
```

**Debugging what the panel sees** — print one snapshot per provider
and exit:

```sh
cosmic-applet-quotabar --debug
```

The output dumps the parsed `ProviderSnapshot` (used percent, reset
timestamp) for each provider, or the underlying error string when a
fetch fails (missing credentials, expired refresh token, HTTP error,
etc.).

**Requirements** — `~/.claude/.credentials.json` from a logged-in
Claude Code install, and/or `~/.codex/auth.json` from a logged-in
Codex install. Both files are produced by `claude login` / `codex
login` respectively; the applet never invokes those flows itself.

## Window Rules applet

`cosmic-applet-windowrules` is the COSMIC counterpart of KDE Plasma's
**KWin Window Rules**, intentionally scoped down to the 80% case: *"when a
window matching this App ID appears, send it to that workspace."*
No OAuth, no API keys, no daemon — it just listens for new toplevels
over `ext-foreign-toplevel-list-v1` and acts on them via
`zcosmic_toplevel_manager_v1::move_to_ext_workspace`.

**What you see** — the panel button shows a workspace-grid icon.
**Left-click** opens a status popup (enabled / total rules, last rule
fired). **Right-click** opens a one-item menu with **Settings…**,
which spawns the standalone rule editor as a regular Wayland toplevel
(survives focus changes).

**The rule editor:**

![Rule editor — three saved rules (Spotify, jetbrains-pycharm, slack) each with Edit / Delete buttons and a "try now" link.](cosmic-applet-windowrules/windowrules-settings.png)

It lets you:

- **Pick a target window from a dropdown** of currently-open toplevels
  — clicking one autofills the App ID, so you don't need to memorise
  `org.mozilla.firefox` vs `Firefox` vs `firefox`. The list is a live
  Wayland-side enumeration, not a guess.
- Optionally filter by a case-insensitive **title substring**
  (e.g. `Private` to send Firefox private windows to a different
  workspace from regular ones).
- Pick the **target workspace** from a dropdown, which shows every
  workspace COSMIC currently exposes with its monitor name and a
  `(pinned)` tag where applicable. Workspaces are output-disambiguated:
  if you have a `"1"` on `eDP-1` and another `"1"` on `DP-4`, the rule
  remembers which one you picked.
- Toggle **"Switch to the chosen workspace"** if you want the rule to
  also focus the destination after moving the window. Off by default.
- Each saved rule has **↑ / ↓ / Edit / Duplicate / Disable / Delete**
  buttons, plus a **try now** link that scans the currently-open
  toplevels and applies the rule to any matching window on demand (so
  existing windows don't have to be reopened to pick up a freshly-added
  rule). The result — "Moved N window(s) to workspace …" or "No matching
  windows." — shows under the row for a few seconds and then fades. The
  rule-uniqueness check rejects only an *exact* duplicate — same
  `(app_id, title_filter)` **and** same workspace + monitor — so genuine
  fallback stacks (see below) stay allowed while accidental true copies
  are caught.
- **Reorder with ↑ / ↓** — rules are matched top-to-bottom and the first
  applicable match wins, so order matters when two rules could touch the
  same window; the arrows move a rule up or down the list.
- **Monitor fallback** — you can add several rules for the *same* window
  that target different workspaces/monitors. The applet applies the
  first (top-most) one whose target monitor is currently connected. So
  a pair like "Slack → workspace 1 on `DP-4`" above "Slack → workspace 1
  on `eDP-1`" sends Slack to the external screen when it's plugged in and
  falls back to the laptop panel when it isn't. Only an *exact* duplicate
  (same window **and** same workspace + monitor) is rejected.
- **Duplicate** clones a rule (disabled) and opens it in the editor. Because
  the uniqueness check forbids an exact-duplicate `(app_id, title_filter)`,
  you must differentiate the copy before saving it.

**Pin your target workspaces** — COSMIC prunes unused workspaces
dynamically (only the ones in active use plus one trailing extra
exist at any moment). If your rule targets workspace `5` but
workspace `5` was pruned before the matching window appears, the move
silently does nothing. The editor includes an in-dialog tip and an
**Open Workspaces overview** button; in the overview, hover the
target's thumbnail and click the pin icon. Pinned workspaces survive
both dynamic pruning and reboots.

**Rule storage** — `cosmic-config` under `com.github.ragusa87.CosmicAppletWindowRules` (no
secrets). The panel applet reloads the config from disk every time it
sees a new toplevel, so edits in the settings window apply
immediately without a restart.

**Debugging what the panel sees** — stream every Wayland subscription
event to stdout:

```sh
cosmic-applet-windowrules --debug
```

This prints capabilities, the workspace list (with `[pinned]` tags),
the open toplevels (with their `app_id` and `title`), and every
`new_toplevel` event as it fires. Useful when figuring out what
`app_id` to put in a rule, or verifying that a workspace really is
pinned.

**Caveat** — cosmic-comp 1.0.x implements
`move_to_ext_workspace` (the v4 toplevel-management request) but
omits it from its hardcoded capability list. The applet detects this
and attempts the request anyway with a one-time warning. Future
cosmic-comp releases will likely advertise it correctly and the
warning will go away on its own.

**Requirements** — a recent COSMIC desktop (cosmic-comp ≥ 1.0
exposing `ext-workspace-v1` + the v4 toplevel-management protocol).
Nothing else.

## Troubleshooting

- **Gmail panel shows `—` forever** → the applet has no credentials;
  right-click → Credentials to authorize.
- **Gmail panel shows `…` forever** / **Agenda countdown never appears with
  credentials configured** → credentials are present but every fetch is
  failing. Run `RUST_LOG=info cosmic-applet-gmail` (or
  `cosmic-applet-google-agenda`) from a terminal and watch the logs.
- **Agenda shows the icon with no countdown** → either no credentials yet
  (right-click → Credentials) or no upcoming event in the next 24h.
- **`Secret Service unavailable`** → no keyring daemon is running.
  Install / start `gnome-keyring-daemon` (it ships with COSMIC by default).
- **Slack badge stays hidden even though Slack is running** → run
  `cosmic-applet-slack --debug` to see whether a `/StatusNotifierItem`
  was found and what the tooltip text is. If three connections show up
  but all skip, Slack may not be exposing its tray icon (toggle
  *Preferences → Notifications → Show a badge* inside Slack). If the
  tooltip wording isn't recognised, adjust the keyword check in
  `cosmic-applet-slack/src/slack.rs::parse_unread`.
- **Refresh token expired after a week** → on Google's OAuth consent
  screen in "Testing" mode, refresh tokens expire after 7 days. Either
  re-authorize once a week, or move the app to "In production" (still no
  review needed for a single-user desktop client).
- **Re-authorize from scratch / revoke access** → visit
  <https://myaccount.google.com/connections>, pick the app, and remove its
  access. The next **Authorize with Google** click will run the full
  consent flow again.
